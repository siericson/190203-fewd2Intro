## Introduction


Hi there I’m **Scott**! I like animals, especially the furry ones. They all know how to live in the present moment, unlike so many of us humans. Here are some of my favorites:


* Dogs
* Cats
* Rabbits
* Squirrels
* Foxes
* Deer
* Goats
* Sea lions
* Sea otters
* Dolphins
* Hummingbirds


I also like architecture because I like to build and make different kinds of things. It’s really great to work for months or maybe years on a project and then see it go up on the job site. Here is my portfolio website (which also includes some animals):
